# NightFall
###A video game for the visually impaired.###
Written for my EPQ at while at Sixth Form, NightFall is a computer game written in Java to be playable by the visually impaired.  
With the gameplay inspired by 2D first person shooters such as Doom, the aim to be playable by the blind added a new challenge.  
In the end, there were no graphics displayed at all, and the player was forced to navigate solely on auditory cues.  

This is a repo representing some of the docs and earlier builds, as the source code has sadly been lost.
